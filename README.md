# 🚀 CI/CD Practice Code

This repository contains my personal practice work for learning **CI/CD pipelines**, including GitHub Actions, Tekton, unit test automation, Docker image builds, and Kubernetes deployments.  
These labs reflect my hands-on learning journey as I build real-world CI/CD skills required for DevOps engineering.

---

## ✅ Purpose of This Repository
- To understand how modern CI/CD pipelines work  
- To practice automating builds, tests, and deployments  
- To gain hands-on experience with Tekton and GitHub Actions  
- To containerize applications and deploy them to Kubernetes  
- To prepare for real-world DevOps projects and internship opportunities
